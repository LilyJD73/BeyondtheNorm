    <h3> My Teaching Philosophy </h3>
        <p>I believe that all students should be seen as individuals first. As a teacher my role is to evaluate each student's understanding of content and structure lesson plans around their prior knowledge. I strive to create lesson plans that address common core and state standards. I endeavor to allow students to connect content to the world around them. I favor hands-on learning and collaborative projects when teaching. For instance when I teach students about special right triangles I am also teaching how an electrician bends a pipe to run wires. My purpose is to teach students to become critical thinkers and valuable contributors to our community.

    <h3> My Learning Journey </h3>
        <p>
        As a teacher it was always important for me to remind my students that I am always learning. In the teaching community we refer to ourselves as lifelong learners. This is why over the summers I like to take on different projects to build skills outside of teaching and mathematics. If I am telling my kids they can do, be, and learn anything then I need to embody the same philosophy. I am currently learning to code. My portfolio is linked below.
